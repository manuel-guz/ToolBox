Important noter: to use vagrant a hypervisor is needed, using Mac ARM architecture is better to use MVware as hypervisor for compatibility purposes.
 The correct version and free one is the VMware Fusion that is compatible with  M1 ARM.  Beyond that, a desktop plug in is necessary to let vagrant connect to the providers like virtualbox, mvware, hyperV, etc.

After that, a package of utilities is required as well tu run and be able to connect everything together. Last thing to keep in mind is the vagrant
 repository where we are going to download the vagrant boxs, called boxhub. We need to make sure that the box is compatible with arm architecture as well. 

When initialising a vagrant box, try not to specify the version. iTerm may not understand the version as  it shows even when the prompt error suggest the
 same version. If not specified, vagrant will use the last version available and probably the correct one.

BOX FOR ARM ARCHITECTURE:

                             vagrant init bento/debian-12 

                       vagrant up --provider vmware_desktop

 

Here the main points:

Here’s a list of steps and things you likely did to troubleshoot and fix the compatibility issues between **Vagrant**, **VMware**, and **macOS M1 ARM**:

**1. Installed VMware Fusion for macOS M1 ARM**

•	VMware Fusion supports macOS M1 (ARM) architecture. You likely installed the **VMware Fusion Player** for Mac with M1 support.

**2. Installed Vagrant**

•	Installed **Vagrant** on your macOS M1 to manage and automate virtual machines.

•	Used the command:

brew install vagrant

**3. Installed VMware Provider for Vagrant**

•	To integrate **Vagrant** with **VMware Fusion**, you installed the **Vagrant VMware plugin** (vagrant-vmware-desktop).

•	You also ensured that you had the **Vagrant VMware Utility** installed to make the integration work.

**4. Installed the Vagrant VMware Utility**

•	You downloaded and installed the **Vagrant VMware Utility**, which is required for VMware Fusion integration with Vagrant.

•	You ran the installer to properly configure the certificates and access the VMware provider:

https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vmware/vagrant-vmware-utility.html

**5. Fixed Missing Certificate Files**

•	Encountered an error about the missing vagrant-utility.client.crt file.

•	To resolve this, you reinstalled or reconfigured the **Vagrant VMware Utility** to ensure that the certificate was in the correct directory (/opt/vagrant-vmware-desktop/certificates).

**6. Used a Compatible Vagrant Box for VMware**

•	You verified and used a **compatible Vagrant box** that works with VMware Fusion, such as bento/debian-12.

•	Ensured that the vagrant box was compatible with **ARM architecture** for your Mac M1.

•	You used the correct command to add a box:

vagrant box add bento/debian-12 --provider=vmware-fusion

**7. Verified the Correct Box Version**

•	Ensured the box version was available and matched the constraints you wanted.

•	Corrected any version mismatch errors and ensured the box you were trying to use was available for VMware Fusion.

**8. Configured the Provider in the Vagrantfile**

•	Modified your Vagrantfile to specify VMware Fusion as the provider:

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
config.vm.box = "bento/debian-12"
config.vm.box_version = "202502.21.0"
config.vm.provider "vmware-fusion" do |vb|
# Custom configurations for VMware Fusion
end
end

**9. Destroyed Existing Machines and Reinitialized**

•	You destroyed any previous machines that were created with incompatible providers (like VirtualBox) and reinitialized the environment with the correct provider (vmware-fusion).

•	Command:

vagrant destroy
vagrant up --provider=vmware-fusion

**10. Checked VM State with vagrant status**

•	Used vagrant status to check if the VM was in the expected state (running or stopped).

•	Resolved any issues where the VM wasn’t ready for SSH by verifying if the VM was correctly created and running.

**11. Used vagrant ssh to Connect to the VM**

•	After the VM was up and running, you used vagrant ssh to connect to the VM for further configuration.

**12. Checked Network Configuration**

•	You ensured that networking was properly configured (bridged, NAT, etc.) in VMware Fusion for proper communication with the VM.

•	Checked the IP address of the VM to ensure that it was accessible for SSH and other operations.

**13. Debugged VMware Errors**

•	Encountered issues where the VM session was aborted and used commands to troubleshoot those errors.

•	Verified VMware Fusion compatibility with your M1 Mac and ensured it was up-to-date.
